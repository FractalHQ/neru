# Unnamed File Router
This is currently __not__ published to npm since it's unnamed and not ready for production

# Development testing
Start off by cloning the repository and opening one terminal window in the dir and one in the dev dir

Run nodemon in the dev dir and reload when testing is needed

- [ ] Method exports support array of functions
- [ ] Middlewear support
